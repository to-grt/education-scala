    /**
     * Recursive functions allow us to write pure and elegant recursive
     * functions. However it comes with a couple of issues
     *   - for starters, recursive functions are slower than iterative
     *     functions.
     *   - but most importantly, they require quiet a bit of memory.
     *
     * Indeed, a recursive function can easily blow the stack, therefore
     * summoning the infamous StackOverflow !
     *
     * Just in case you are not familiar with the JVM call stack, here
     * is a quick overlook of what it is:
     *
     *   - each JVM thread has a call stack
     *   - each stack stores som stack frames
     *   - a stack frame is called every time a method is called (I bet
     *     you get where i'm going)
     *   - each stack frame can have a different size given the method
     *     parameters and algorithm
     *   - stack frames are useful to keep the state of the function
     *
     * In short, multiple recursive calls will "stack" some stack frames
     * up until it all blows up
     *
     * However, and because recursive functions are some important in
     * FP, functional languges usually implement a tail call
     * optimization.
     *
     * Methods that are able to use tail call optimizations are called
     * tail recursive
     *
     * Basically, tail call optimization allows the JVM not to add a new
     * stack frame everytime a recursive call is made to the condition
     * that the recursive call is the LAST statement executed in the
     * function.
     *
     * The point is, because there are no statements after the recursive
     * call, preserving the state and stack frame of the parent function
     * is not useful
     *
     * Here comes an example:
